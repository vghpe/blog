It has been a bit too cumbersome to make posts because I always have to navigate around the Hugo directory and remember how to write out the front matter of Markdown files. Here's what a typical structure looks like for a Hugo blog post:


```
---
title: "OSX app for blog post"
date: 2025-02-18T20:59:38
draft: false
tags: ["fluff"]
image: "images/2025_02_18.jpeg"
---
{Body}
```

So I made an app using AppleScript that creates a Markdown file in the blog content directory, fills out a front matter template, and opens the file in Sublime. Check it out:


<details>
<summary>Expand Script</summary>

```
set blogDir to "/Users/xxxx/blog/content/posts/"
set imageDir to "images/" -- Hugo expects images here

-- Generate date stamp
set dateStamp to do shell script "date +%Y-%m-%d"

-- Initialize counter
set counter to 1
set fileName to dateStamp & "-untitled.md"
set filePath to blogDir & fileName

-- Check if the file exists, and increment the counter
repeat while (do shell script "test -e " & quoted form of filePath & "; echo $?") = "0"
	set counter to counter + 1
	set fileName to dateStamp & "-untitled-" & counter & ".md"
	set filePath to blogDir & fileName
end repeat

set imageFile to imageDir & dateStamp & ".jpeg" -- Assumes image matches the date

-- Create the Markdown file
do shell script "echo '---
title: \"\"
date: '$(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S)'
draft: false
tags: [\"fluff\"]
image: \"" & imageFile & "\"
---
' > " & quoted form of filePath

-- Open in Sublime Text
tell application "Sublime Text"
	open filePath
end tell
```
</details>

Works Great!

### Logline:

Reality rips, and 4 strangers awakes on a stalled star-born train. To return, they must cross nine platforms, mend what’s broken, and confront the pull of a world that feels more like home than the one they left.

### Theme

Authentic Belonging vs. Expected Duty

Sub-themes:
- Desire and Longing, 
- Identity
- Determinism
### Core Concepts

- **The Line** — The train carries each life forward along its ordinary course
- **Snap‑Out / Snap‑In** — When the train stops, people are pulled **out** of their lives to the station. When it moves again, they **snap back in** to the exact instant they left; no time passes for their world.
- **Stops** — The train only stops when a station malfunctions.
- **All‑Four Rule** — Departure is approved only when **all passanger** board together.
## World

- **The Station** — Nine platforms are suspended in space, laid out in a grid next to the the train line. Each platform is rich on life, warm and community. Locals live here.
- **Inhabitants & Tongue** — The **Guide** is a local. Other residents follow daily rituals; their language is unintelligible to the four strangers. Communication relies on gesture, tone, and inference.
- **The Inner Layers** —  Each platform’s has a stack of virtual layers, a ghost-like space. The first layer stays linked to its occupants; deeper layers are older and more system-like, hostile to intrusion. The Guide can support the protagonist there but each deep descent strains her, leaving visible effects.
- **Map**

### Act 1

The story opens with a brief snapshot of the protagonist in the middle of their _expected_ human life, just moments before a major milestone ). Something in their demeanor, a strained tick, suggests a quiet absence, a sense that something essential is missing.

Without warning reality collapses. The protagonist and 3 others find themselves sitting together on a stationary train adrift in a living starfield.

They step out onto the single top platform. Humid air presses close, greenery spills across the edges, and the sound of distant water carries on the breeze. The train’s track stretches in a straight, impossible line into the starry void in both directions. They hesitate, argue, and begin to explore.

A local figure appears Guide. They speak only when necessary. Rules emerge in fragments over several encounters: the track is a single line; the train stops only when something malfunctions; all four must be present to depart.

By the end of this act, the group resolves to repair whatever has gone wrong. If they can fix it, the train will move, and they can return to the lives they left behind.

### Act 2

The group splits up, fanning out across the platforms to gather what’s needed for the repair. Locals offer small, indirect forms of help, but the language barrier keeps every exchange partial and strange.

The Guide begins showing the protagonist how to connect with the inner layers of the platforms. In the first layer, they can still interact with the occupants directly, almost like a ghost moving through the world. Some repairs require diving into older, more mechanical system-like layers where the Guide cannot physically follow.

As the protagonist travels through these spaces, the platforms reveal themselves through scenes of care and community — tended gardens, shared rituals, acts of quiet intimacy. Each offers its own argument for staying, suggesting a belonging that may feel more genuine than what the passengers left behind.

Meanwhile, tensions mount. The younger passenger drifts toward desire. The older two grow impatient and urgent. The protagonist is caught between the magnetic pull of this new world and the responsibility of returning to the one they came from.

### Act 3

The train is restored, and departure is finally possible — yet the existence of a ninth, still-unvisited platform becomes clear. The Guide’s behavior shifts, threaded with unease and hints of unfinished business. The protagonist realizes they could deceive the others and slip away to see what lies there.

On the ninth platform, the protagonist is confronted with the answer to their deepest,  longing. The experience is a tangle of confusion, sadness, and panic. When the Guide reaches to comfort them, they flinch, startled by their own unfamiliarity with closeness.

Back on the train, the all-four rule traps everyone: if one boards, all board; if one stays, all stay. The older woman insists on returning out of love. The older man insists on returning out of fear. The younger demands to remain. The protagonist stands at the breaking point, aware they could use their layer-moving ability to incapacitate the others and make the choice alone.

The decision splits the ending:

- **Return** — They board. The story snaps back into the Act 1 opening scene, as if nothing happened. After a quiet beat, the kitchen clock’s ticking draws focus. The shot lingers on the protagonist’s eyes as a small light leaves them. The clock ticks on. Life continues.
    
- **Stay** — The protagonist quietly puts the older passengers to sleep, denying them the return to their lives. The younger rushes toward the ninth platform, and we follow them into it.

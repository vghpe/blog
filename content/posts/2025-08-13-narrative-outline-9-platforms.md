---

Reality rips, and 4 strangers comes to on a stalled star-born train. To return, they must explore 9 platforms, mend what’s broken, and confront the pull of a world that feels more like home than the one they left.

## Theme

*Authentic Belonging vs. Expected Duty*

Sub-themes: *Desire, Identity, Determinism*


## Core Concepts

- **The Line** — The train carries each life forward along its ordinary course

- **Snap‑Out / Snap‑In** — When the train stops, people are pulled **out** of their lives to the station. When it moves again, they **snap back in** to the exact instant they left; no time passes for their world.

- **Stops** — The train only stops when a station malfunctions.

- **All‑Four Rule** — Departure is approved only when **all passenger** board together.

## World

- **The Station** — Nine platforms are suspended in space, laid out in a grid next to the the train line. Each platform is rich on life, warm and community. Locals live here.

- **Inhabitants & Tongue** — The **Guide** is a local. Other residents follow daily rituals; their language is unintelligible to the four strangers. Communication relies on gesture, tone, and inference.

- **The Inner Layers** —  Each platform’s has a stack of virtual layers, a ghost-like space. The first layer stays linked to its occupants; deeper layers are older and more system-like, hostile to intrusion. The Guide can support the protagonist there but each deep descent strains her, leaving visible effects.

### Act 1

The story opens with a brief snapshot of the protagonist in the middle of their _expected_ human life, just moments before a major milestone ). Something in their demeanor, a strained tick, suggests a quiet absence, a sense that something essential is missing.

Without warning reality collapses. The protagonist and 3 others find themselves sitting together on a stationary train adrift in a living starfield.

They step out onto a platform. The train’s track stretches in a straight line into the starry void in both directions. They hesitate, argue, and begin to explore.

A figure appears the Guide. Rules emerge in fragments over several encounters: the track is a single line; the train stops only when something malfunctions; all passangers must be present to depart.

By the end of this act, the group resolves to repair whatever has gone wrong. If they can fix it, the train will move, and they can return to the lives they left behind.

### Act 2

The group splits up, The Guide begins showing the protagonist how to connect with the inner layers of the platforms. In the first layer, they can still interact with the occupants directly, almost like a ghost moving through the world. Some repairs require diving into older, more mechanical system where the Guide cannot follow.

As the protagonist visits each platforms, they see care and community by the locals — tended gardens, shared rituals, acts of intimacy. A closeness and rich belonging that the protagonist aches for. It makes a quiet argument for staying.  

Meanwhile, tensions mount. The younger passenger drifts toward desire, and question the authenticity of the reality they left. The older two grow impatient and urgent to return to their loved ones. 

### Act 3

The train is restored, and departure is possible, yet... the existence of a 9th, still-unvisited platforms is apparent. Guide has been acting strange, hinting toward unfinished business. The protagonist can deceive the others in order to seek out the space. 

On the 9th platform, the protagonist is confronted with the answer to their deepest longing. The experience is a tangle of confusion, sadness, and panic. When the Guide reaches to comfort them, they flinch, startled by their own unfamiliarity with closeness.

Back on the train, tension boils over, The younger passenger demands to remain but the passengers rule states they all must return. The protagonist stands at the breaking point, aware they could use their layer-moving ability to incapacitate the others and make the choice for them. 

The decision splits the ending:

- **Return** — They board. The story snaps back into the Act 1 opening scene, as if nothing happened. The important life event plays out. Then a quiet beat, the kitchen clock’s ticking draws focus. The shot lingers on the protagonist’s eyes we see their strained tick, the clock ticks on. Life continues.

- **Stay** — The protagonist puts the older passengers to sleep, denying them the return to their lives. The younger rushes toward the 9th platform, and the protagonist follows, discovering they have entered the layers. A final descent deep into the ninth platform’s layers is required to bring the youngest passenger back.

  The Guide is able to help but must push themselves further than they can handle, paying a great cost. After completing a difficult sequence of puzzles, the protagonist succeeds in bringing the youngest passenger back. The Guide then asks the protagonist to take on their role as steward of the platforms. While the youngest passenger shows potential for the role, it is not yet their time.
  
  By accepting, the protagonist undergoes a transition. They are no longer a passenger but a caretaker and steward of the station. This change alters the return rule of the train, as there are now only three passengers left. 
  
  The 3 passenger board the train and return to their lives just as they were, no memory of the events that happened. The train departs the station continuing toward it's cosmic destination far far away.

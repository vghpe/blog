The guide covers both Windows and macOS and is designed for people who haven’t used command-line tools before. Command-line tools let you talk directly to programs that don’t have a graphical interface. <!--more-->

What we’re doing here is fairly simple. Still, I encourage you to double-check the sources and confirm the commands rather than blindly trusting a blog.

On Windows we’ll use **PowerShell** (the built-in command tool), and on macOS we’ll use **Terminal** (the Mac equivalent). In this guide we’re going to use these tools:

- **gallery-dl** — the program that will download the media from X.  
- **Get cookies.txt LOCALLY** — a browser extension that saves your login session into a text file so gallery-dl can fetch your bookmarks and likes.  

Here is a very brief outline of what we’ll do:  

1. [Set up folders](#step-1-set-up-folders)  
2. [Install gallery-dl](#step-2-install-gallery-dl)  
3. [Install Get cookies.txt LOCALLY and export your cookies](#step-3-install-get-cookiestxt-locally-and-export-your-cookies)  
4. [Create the config file](#step-4-create-the-config-file)  
5. [Start downloading](#step-5-start-downloading)  


## Safety Note  
This method uses your Twitter login cookies. Cookies are small files your browser uses to stay logged in, and in this case they let gallery-dl fetch your likes and bookmarks. If someone else gets that file, they can use your account until you log out or clear sessions.

The applications we're going to use (*gallery-dl* & *Get cookies.txt LOCALLY*) are both open source, well regarded and widely checked. I recommend you confirm this yourself, never share your `cookies.txt`, and delete it when you’re done.

## Step 1: Set up folders

On your Desktop create a new folder called **TwitterDownloader**.  Inside it, create another folder called **downloads**.  

Your folder structure should look like this:

```
Desktop
└── TwitterDownloader
    └── downloads
```


---

## Step 2: Install gallery-dl  

How you install depends on OS, version, and any previous Python installs. The steps below are the route that works for most people.

**macOS**  
1. Install Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
   - Download the latest macOS installer and run it. This also sets up `pip`.  
2. Install gallery-dl:  
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install -U gallery-dl
   ```  
3. Verify the install:  
   ```bash
   python3 -m gallery_dl --version
   ```

You've probably installed brew. If you've installed brew I trust that you can work out the next step to complete the installation.
</details>

**Windows**  
1. Download the standalone executable from the [gallery-dl GitHub releases page](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/releases).  
2. Put `gallery-dl.exe` in your **TwitterDownloader** folder (created in Step 1).  
3. Open PowerShell at the right folder:  
   - Right-click the **TwitterDownloader** (Windows 11) folder or Shift + Right-click (older Windows)
   - Choose **Open in Terminal** (Windows 11) or **Open PowerShell window here** (older Windows).  
4. Verify the install:  
   ```powershell
   .\gallery-dl.exe --version
   ```  

<details><summary>Troubleshooting error: not a valid application</summary>
If you see a “Not a valid application for this platform” error:  

- First install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable referenced on the gallery-dl GitHub page.  
- If it still fails, download the **x86** build from the releases page and run it using its exact filename, for example:  `.\gallery-dl_x86.exe` instead of `.\gallery-dl.exe`
</details>

## Step 3: Install Get cookies.txt LOCALLY and export your cookies

We need your Twitter login cookies so gallery-dl can fetch your likes and bookmarks.  
To do this we use a browser extension called **Get cookies.txt LOCALLY**. 

1. Install the extension:  
   - [Chrome/Edge/Brave](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc)  
   - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/get-cookies-txt-locally/)  

1. Go to x/Twitter and make sure you're signed in. 

2. While on the website, open the "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" extension. Set export format to *Netscape*, Press Export As, navigate to our *TwitterDownloader* folder on the desktop and save it as: `x.com_cookies.txt`


![Export Window of the extension](/images/get_cookies_locally.png)

After this step, your folder should look like this:

```
Desktop
└── TwitterDownloader
    ├── downloads
    ├── x.com_cookies.txt
    └── gallery-dl.exe   (Windows only)
```

---
## Step 4: Create the config file

We now need to create a file that tells gallery-dl what to download and where to save it.  
This file is called `config.json`.

1. Open a text editor like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac (if using TextEdit make sure you're in plaintext mode "Format > Make Plaintext") 
2. Copy the following content into the file:  

```json
{
  "base-directory": "downloads",
  "extractor": {
    "twitter": {
      "cookies": "x.com_cookies.txt",
      "videos": true,
      "retweets": false,
      "quoted": false,
      "replies": false,
      "directory": [],
      "filename": "{tweet_id}_{author[name]}_{num}.{extension}"
    }
  }
}

```
3. Save the file as **config.json** inside your **TwitterDownloader** folder.  Make sure it is saved as `config.json` and not `config.json.txt`.


### What this config does
- **base-directory** → tells gallery-dl to save everything in the `downloads` folder. 
- **cookies** → points gallery-dl to the file you exported in Step 3.  
- **videos: true** → downloads videos as well as images.  
- **retweets / quoted / replies: false** → only downloads media from original tweets you liked or bookmarked. Adjust if needed. 
- **filename** → gives every file a name that includes the tweet ID and author. 

After this step, your folder should look like this:

```
Desktop
└── TwitterDownloader
    ├── downloads
    ├── x.com_cookies.txt
    ├── config.json
    └── gallery-dl.exe   (Windows only)
```

---
# Step 5: Start downloading

For either Windows or Mac we just need to make sure we're in the right folder. Open Powershell or Terminal type first type

```bash
cd
```

Hit **space** then drag-and-drop the TwitterDownloader folder into the window. That will print out it's path. Hit **enter**

![This works both on Windows and MacOS](/images/twitter_path.png)


We're ready to transfer! Run these commands one at a time. Make sure to replace `<your-username>` with your own username and remove the brackets '<>'. 

**macOS**

```bash
python3 gallery-dl --config config.json "https://x.com/i/bookmarks"
```

```bash
python3 gallery-dl --config config.json "https://x.com/<your-username>/likes"
```

**Windows**

```powershell
.\gallery-dl.exe --config .\config.json "https://x.com/i/bookmarks"
```

```powershell
.\gallery-dl.exe --config .\config.json "https://x.com/<your-username>/likes"
```

---

All the media will appear inside the **downloads** folder.  Each file name will include the tweet ID, so you can always reconstruct the original link:

```
https://x.com/i/status/<tweet_id>
```

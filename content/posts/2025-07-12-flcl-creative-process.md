When working on narrative-heavy games, I spend a lot of time balancing the story-”telling” to make plot-important events clear. The assumption goes: A confused audience is an unhappy audience.

But then I think about *FLCL*, an anime I instantly loved but didn’t initially understand. It was frantic, absurdist, hilarious, and extremely stylistic. I’ve wondered for years: How does something like that even come together?

FLCL, or Fooly Cooly, is a GAINAX studio anime mini-series from the year 2000, directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki. Through sourcing interviews and production material, the following is an attempt to provide some insight into the creative process of this cult show. And, in doing so perhaps come to some clarity in how audiences react when story-telling rules are broken.

## My Next Girl will be Nothing like my Ex Girl


FLCL lives in the shadow of *Neon Genesis Evangelion*, GAINAX’s pioneering series that aired in 1995 and concluded (temporarily) with the 1997 film *The End of Evangelion*.

Speaking to *mynavi.jp* in 2010, Tsurumaki stated that in the year following Evangelion’s completion, he juggled numerous ideas for his directorial debut but struggled to solidify any one concept. After taking a break to assist with the production of *His and Her Circumstances (1998)*, he tried again, resolving to be less of a perfectionist, focusing more on the things he loved and less on the things that brought stress.¹

In the book *FLCLick Noise*, 2010 Tsurumaki recalls that at this time GAINAX underwent significant changes in the animation staff, impairing the studio’s ability to execute highly realistic animation. But unlike Evangelion, where the directors imposed strict style-guides on the animators, Tsurumaki wanted FLCL to be an animation playground.²

The intention was for FLCL to be the opposite of Evangelion’s somber tone, to be outrageous and wacky. Speaking at the Otokon Convention in 2001, Tsurumaki remarked:

> With Evangelion, there was this feeling that you had better be smart to understand it, or even just to work on it. With FLCL I want to say that it’s okay to feel stupid.

This sentiment not only encapsulates the experience of viewing FLCL, but it also speaks to its themes: growth, what it means to be an adult, and taking chances to learn new things — even if you look silly doing it.

## Scribbles to Structures

In the 2019 book FLCL Archives, we can see the early scribbles by Tsurumaki in what would become FLCL. These notes already capture the theme, some of the characters, and the setting.

The later, more refined outlines are signed by FLCL’s screenplay writer, Yoji Enokido. Staff comments from the DVD commentary³, FLCL Noise⁴, and in the afterword of the 2007 novelization⁵ make it clear that Enokido played a major role in developing the show’s characters, their interpersonal dynamics, and the snappy, metaphor-heavy dialogue.

For Enokido, like any good writer, it’s all about tying everything back to the theme, regardless of how absurd it gets.

> It doesn’t matter if the content is completely absurd. Rather, it is this surface absurdity with which we compete for. However, there is only one thing that must not be a lie — the creator’s wish to express the theme.
>
> — Yoji Enokido FLCL, Ultimate Edition Booklet (2007)

Reviewing GAINAX’s production timeline⁶ and the dates noted in FLCL Archives⁷, we can estimate that it took 2–3 months from the early draft until they had a refined pitch. It was going to be a six-episode Coming-of-Age story featuring comedy and action.

For the structure, it's a suprisingly standard boy-meets-girl story but they team pushes the tropes to absurdity. For example what's a FLCL version of the cute bump-in scene? 

>"Well, what if he got run over? Or, what if he got hit with the guitar?" Things like that, make it full of nonsense.
>
>— Tsurumaki, DVD Commentary, eps 1 (2002)

My impression is that Tsurumaki had been thinking about the theme of maturity for some time before pre-production. The earliest scribbles include a graph where the characters are plotted by their maturity and age.

## Some early casting and a lucky break

An early decision that would play a major role in defining the show’s spirit was the casting of stage actress Mayumi Shintani to voice Haruko — the selfish, violent, possibly alien character that wreaks havoc on the protagonist’s life.

Character designer Sadamoto noted that he was struggling with Haruko’s design for a long time, but when he heard Ms. Shintani was cast, it finally came together.

>With a voice like that I couldn’t help but imagine a mean face, and as a result Haruko’s face turned out like, well, how it did (laughs) .
>
>— Sadamoto, FLCLick Noise, Episode 1

The music was also picked in pre-production. Tsurumaki stated that he lacked confidence in directing composers. To him, a great score is when a well-known, great track is laid on top of the animation.

It was this line of thinking that led him to approach The Pillows, his favorite band, not to commission them for new songs, but to use their back catalog for the score.


>So if, by any chance, The Pillows said, “Don’t use any of the existing songs, order a custom soundtrack from us,” I would have been in a lot of trouble, I think.
>
>— Tsurumaki, FLCLick Noise, Episode 1

Making this choice in pre-production significantly skewed the tonality of the show. Instead of animating and then placing music to fit, the animation was set to the music (or with the music in mind), similar to music-video production.

## Let’s wreak stuff! Break the format

In traditional anime production, once an episode’s script is completed, it’s handed over to the Episode Director and Storyboard Artist, who draw a storyboard (a sequence of sketches to map out the scenes planned for the episode). Once drawn, the storyboard is returned, reviewed, and corrected by the Series Director. This was the formal structure GAINAX had been operating under.

In FLCLick Noise, Tsurumaki alludes to the fact that the formality of this structure was loosened by letting the Storyboard Artist be part of the early development of the script.

> I wanted to play to Imaishi’s strengths… (a) poetic and subdued tone… might have been my personal preference… but it wouldn’t have had the strength to make people still love it even after ten years .
>
>— Tsurumaki, FLCLick Noise, Episode 5

This would generate wildly different animation styles between scenes and episodes depending on which animator was responsible. The mixing of styles also created interesting contrasts, such as Hiramatsu’s skill in conveying intimacy with Imaishi’s wild Kanada style for slapstick comedy.

>We wanted to convey the message that “this anime is chaotic and anything goes.” We wanted it to be just “animation” without any restrictions on expression typical of the genre.
>
>— Tsurumaki, FLCLick Noise, Episode 1

In FLCLick Noise, we learn that there were several instances where the Storyboard Artists would improvise additional sequences that weren’t mentioned in the script at all⁸. These off-script sequences could be wacky or fun, but they could also misdirect the viewer trying to make sense of the plot. In a 2002 Pulp — The Manga Magazine interview, Tsurumaki commented:


>I wanted to have it more in the style of a Japanese TV commercial or promotional video — it’s short, but it’s dense-packed. That’s the look I was aiming for.

![Atomsk Concept by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto](/images/features/flcl-bird.jpg)

With the script getting filled with obscure J-pop culture and anime sub-culture jokes⁹, the animation team is going more off-model and off-script. It’s clear that communicating the plot wasn’t the priority.

In a 2010 interview for mynavi.jp, Tsurumaki notes that he told writer Enokido to skip beats in the dialogue flow and omit everything they didn’t think was important, including elements of the Sci-Fi setting.¹⁰

He also maintains in several interviews that making a layered show was a conscious choice¹¹ ¹². In FLCLick Noise, he states that he didn’t want to disrespect the DVD buyers by selling them something they would understand at first viewing.


I’m a bit skeptical about how intentional or thought-out this layering was. There are moments in FLCLick Noise¹³ and in the DVD commentary¹⁴ where Tsurumaki acknowledges and apologizes for some of the narrative leaps. That said, I don’t think it would’ve become the cult show it is had the plotting been gentler.

First and foremost, I believe Tsurumaki wanted to break the rules and let animation shine. The team packed it dense, and the effect of that, depending on the viewer, was a flashy but incomprehensible series of events or a captivating narrative puzzle.

## Production! Finally, some rigor and rules. Right?

GAINAX worked in collaboration with Production I.G. during production. This is where storyboards are turned into video. Even here, where anime production is at its most streamlined, a few stylistic twists still slipped in.

In a traditional anime production, each episode has an assigned Animation Director who distributes a number of cuts among the Key Animators. They will draw the essential frames, which are then passed back to the Animation Director for a consistency check and any necessary corrections.¹⁵ ¹⁶

As recounted by Tsurumaki in FLCL Noise¹⁷, Shinya Ohira, a renowned senior from Ghibli, was under contract with Production I.G at the time and got assigned a few cuts for a scene on the porch in episode 2. However, when the senior returned his keyframes, they looked distinctly unlike anything else; it was hard to even tell who the characters were.

The work was supposed to be cleaned up, but a younger Animation Director felt intimidated by the senior and delayed making corrections. With the deadline looming and the young director procrastinating, they simply decided to leave it, add some subtitles with names, and call it a day. After all, it’s FLCL.

The number one priority for Tsurumaki was to not do Evangelion. So he let the staff free to express and improvise, and with the highly talented animators at GAINAX, they created some truly wacky stuff.

It is a process not free of apparent conflict. Tsurumaki mentions struggles with staff more accustomed to the traditional structure¹⁸, and the pre-production staff would have seen some pretty drastic changes to their work. In FLCLick Noise, character designer Sadamoto notes some reluctance to the heavy modification of his designs¹⁹, and I can imagine Writer Enokido similarly saw a lot of his storytelling reduced.

Intentional or not, the obfuscation of the plot works in the case of FLCL. Unlike Evangelion, the show doesn’t spawn the spirit of the author, judgingly whispering, “You’re just too much of a dumb-dumb to get it.”


Why is that?

I think it comes down to the original intention: “It’s ok to be dumb! Now look at all this fun nonsense we made!”

Music Videos are often nonsense, but if we enjoy the song, it demands our attention over and over again. FLCL captures that energy, and if you’re into it, the narrative depth underneath becomes an enticing puzzle to unravel.

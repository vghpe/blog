Imagine a job that requires you to daily find or manufacture the next outrage. Stability, for you, means there’s new anger to tap into.

I’ve been eying this kind of content for almost a decade now. I tell myself; it’s to better understand and I need to be curious to be empathetic. But there’s very little to understand here, and I’m honestly just rage-watching.

It’s simply compelling to people because it’s exactly what they want to hear.

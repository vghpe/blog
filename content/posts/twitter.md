I collect a lot of art that I would like to write about. Downloading and reposting is against copyright but I can Embeed Tweets like this. It looks ok enough, I'll use it when I need to. I'll first try to reach the artist see if they can let me post their art. But it's get a bit trickier if I want to discus something like this Nausica√§ concept. 

I also added the ability to add caption to images. So if I do get to share someone else art I can credit them direcly under the image (and in the post).

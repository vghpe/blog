Finished MGS2 again for the first time in I think 20 years. Still so much fun, I did a whole lot of a research behind the scenes and I hope to share more in the future. 

But a couple of observations: 
- It’s totally a toy. With a lot of replayability. I immediately felt an urge to play it all again upon completion. 
- The cast is memorable. All very charismatic and fun. I think it’s the best in the series. 
- Without the ‘shock’ (and probably disappointment for many hyped players) with Riden not Snake serving as the lead. As a storytelling device it’s a great perspective to experience the story. 
- The final act still feels like a mess 20 years later. the amount of turn in the story is just too dense it exhausting.  hiding behind “postmodernism” doesn’t make it less tiring.

I decided to catalog internet "grievances" over the *Intergalactic* reveal trailer at The Game Awards 2024. 

Why am I doing this? Well. I.. don't.. get it. So let's do some science!! <!--more-->

It can be hard to pull out the true grievances from the layers of memes, obsession over like/dislike ratios, and content creators with questionable motives who financially benefit from outrage.

The quotes below are gathered from users on Reddit, X, Youtube and Instagram. I ignored anything that seemed purely spiteful and focused on repeating patterns.

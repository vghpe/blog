What makes the writing stand out in Disco Elysium? That’s a big question for many posts, but let’s start here:

Is it the writing or the execution? Let’s strip things out and compare. 

Note this clip will only be meaningful if you’ve played the game; in isolation, this test will make zero sense.

Now let’s take away the VO and only run it with music.

And finally, let’s just do VO.

I think the strength of the VO is more in establishing a tone. It’s weird and bizarre, but the delivery of these specific lines isn’t anything outstanding.

The music and SFX really help with the mood and also let me stay focused and engaged. Try muting the video and see the difference. Suddenly, the experience is worse than reading a book.

But ultimately, it’s the written idea here—that our conscious experience is nothing more than being an evil ape competing against other evil apes on a giant ball —that is humorous and thought-provoking.

I’m going to give Robert Kurvitz book Sacred And Terrible Air a read next. It has recently been fan translated from Estonian.

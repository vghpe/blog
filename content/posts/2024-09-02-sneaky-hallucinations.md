The translation project of Kojima's MGS2 dev diary just got a lot more complicated. Here’s the previously assumed airtight process:

I have scans of the in-development diary in Japanese. I use ChatGPT to both transcribe and translate them. This way, I can check for hallucinations at both stages.

- The transcript must match the image. I verify a few Japanese characters at the start and end of paragraphs.

- I cross-compare the AI translation with Google Translate's version of the transcript.

Hallucinations tend to run wild, so while the Google Translate version might be worse, I can ensure that the ChatGPT translation hasn’t gone rogue. However, ChatGPT doesn’t seem to handle blurred text well—it needs to be really crisp, or it will make up characters.

I grew suspicious of the output because the text was so blurry, and the characters didn’t quite match up in the transcript.

I did some tests and realized just how fragile the image interpretation was. Using sharpening tools made no difference. This cast a giant shadow of doubt over all previous translations.

I can’t read a word of Japanese, so spot-checking a few characters between the scan and the transcript is all I can do. But with this fragility my spot check just doesn't feel like enough and leaves a big room for error. 

I was ready to give up here. This AI project was never meant to be a true translation but rather a tool for the community to use to get there quickly. But a fabricated AI transcript could actually be worse!

Google Translate gave me some hope. Its image interpreter seemed to perform much better. While the translation was clearly off, it did a better job at reading the scans.

So, I tried Gemini, Google’s AI, and it produced a seemingly perfect transcript of the blurry scan! I tried to look really carefully through the whole sample text. 

Gemini also does a decent job at translating, though not as good as ChatGPT. So the new process is going to be: Gemini transcript -> ChatGPT translation.

The unfortunate thing is that I’m going to have to redo many hours of work to double-check everything I’ve done so far.

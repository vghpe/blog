Here's a quick test of a Unity Web project. I can only build uncompressed for now so it's an 80MB load instead of 6MB, and you might to flip that ringer switch on the side of you phone to hear the audio. 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin-top: 20px;">
  <iframe
    src="/unity-project/index.html"
    width="270"
    height="480"
    frameborder="0"
    scrolling="no"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

But this is pretty cool! I'll make an actual half decent level next.

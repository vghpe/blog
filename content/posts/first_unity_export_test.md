Here's a quick test of a Unity Web project. I can only build uncompressed for now so it's an 80MB load instead of 6MB, not sure how to solve that yet. 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin-top: 20px;">
  <iframe
    src="/unity-project/index.html"
    width="270"
    height="480"
    frameborder="0"
    scrolling="no"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

Feel free to check it out and let me know if there are any issues!

Here's a quick test of a Unity Web project. GitHub Pages doesn't seem to support `Content-Encoding`, so I can only build uncompressed for now. **That means it's an 80MB load instead of 6MB (Brotli).** You might want to flip the ringer switch on the side of your phone to hear the audio.

{{< iframe src="/unity-project/index.html" allowfullscreen="true" >}}

But this is pretty cool! I'll make a half-decent level next. Let me know if you have any issues or know how I can get Brotli compression to work here.

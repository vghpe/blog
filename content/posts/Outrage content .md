Imagine a job that requires you to find or manufacture the next outrage daily. Stability, for you, means there’s always new anger to tap into.

I’ve been eying this kind of content for almost a decade now. I tell myself it’s to better understand, and i need to be curious to be empathetic. But there’s very little to understand here, and I’m honestly just rage-watching.

It’s simply compelling to people because it’s exactly what they want to hear.

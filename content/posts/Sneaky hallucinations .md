This translation project just got a lot more complicated. Here the assumed air-tight process I’ve used so far. 

I have the scans of the in dev diary in Japanese. I’ve get chat GTP to both transcribe then translated. That way, I can check against hallucinations in both phases. 

- The transcript must match the image. I check a few Japanese character at the start and end of paragraphs. 

- I cross compare the AI translation to Google translate of the transcript. 

Hallucinations tend to go wild. So while the Google translation will be worse I can check that the gtp translation hasn’t gone rogue. 

However! GTP doesn’t seem to handles blurred text, it needs to be real crisp or will make up a characters. 

It was a bit suspicious on output because it was so blurry. And the characters didn’t quite match up in the transcript.

I did some test and just started to realize how fragile the image interpretation was. And using sharpening tools really made mid difference. This casted a giant shadow of doubt in all previous translation. 

I can’t read a word of Japanese so spot comparison of a few character between the capture and the transcript is all I can do. But this fragility leave so much room for error. 

I was ready to give up here. This AI project was never meant to be a true translation but a tool for the community to get there quickly. But made up AI falsehood could actually be worse!

But Google translate gave me some hope. Its image interpreter seemed to do much better here. Its translation was clearly wack but it seemed at reading the scans. 

So I tried out Gemini googles AI and it produced a seemingly perfect transcript of the blurry scan! 

Gemini also does a decent job at translating but not as good as Chat-GTP. So the new process is going to be. Gemini transcript -> GTP translation. 

The sucky thing is that I’m going to have to redo many hours of work to double check all previous done so far.

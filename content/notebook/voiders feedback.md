The main loop is one that’s proven to work well with proximity chat. It forces players to spread out and handle different jobs. They have to delegate, pick up new information on their own, then track down others to pass it along.

Each player is like a small packet of information in a network (the ship’s layout) that needs to cross paths with others to share what they know. Delegation and roles can also just be agreed on within the team. In a way, it’s as much about people and communication management as it is about keeping the ship running.

The concept isn’t inherently competitive like Counter-Strike with Terrorists vs Counter-Terrorists. It could just as easily be a single-group progression model, more like Overcooked.

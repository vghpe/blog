**Title:** How to stimulate the male nipple 

**Genre**: Platforming Auto-Runner, Dating Sim, Puzzle

**Artist statement**: The male nipple is so enigmatic! How does one touch it? Does it do anything? Do you know? Prove it!

HTSMN is an relationship/intimacy sim disguised as an auto-runner puzzle platformer.  Through basic platforming you manipulate parameters inside a selected hottie's 'box', each with their own quirks. The goal is to reach "peak arousal".


---

**Gameplay:** 
The playable jumper will ping-pong inside a rectangular canvas with a center-stage knob (nipple). The knob can be run over or jumped on—but be careful! It’s particular, and the wrong type of engagement will cause it to shy away.

System depth is added through in-canvas elements that evolve or grow with each cycle we pass through or over them. Additional outside canvas elements, like the profile portrait, need to be observed for state changes or monitored to see how they respond to our collisions.

Like any good dating sim, there are many character parameters—some visible, others hidden. The path to arousal isn’t a simple linear temperature gauge.

**Art**:
The art is non-explicit, but highly suggestive in its springy physicality, shapes, and juicy animation. The roster should be filled with hotties.

The game should comply with video platform guidelines, so players can stream it without needing to switch to an 18+ channel.

**Tech**:
A JavaScript build (written in TypeScript) playable at HowToStimulateMaleNipple.com, available on desktop and mobile. A single button/tap input keeps it simple.

**Why it will be a hit**: The cheeky playfulness, “dating sim” character hotties, and the gauntlet of arousing the hardest character are designed to attract streamers, letting them prove to their audience that they are, in fact, a “pro arouser” with unmatched “touch prowess.”

**Prototype: Jamble**

Try a tiny prototype of the basic auto running below. Controls: Space to jump; Left/Right arrows to move; the runner auto-moves when the ground line is touched.

<div class="jamble-embed" style="margin: 1rem 0;">
  <div id="jamble-game"></div>
  <!-- Pass a hidden debug container to avoid overlay UI on the page -->
  <div id="jamble-debug" style="display:none;"></div>
</div>

<script src="/blog/games/jamble/jamble.js"></script>
<script>
  (function () {
    function initJamble() {
      var gameRoot = document.getElementById('jamble-game');
      var debugRoot = document.getElementById('jamble-debug');
      if (!gameRoot || !(window.Jamble && Jamble.Game)) return;
      try {
        var game = new Jamble.Game(gameRoot, debugRoot);
        // Start in run state to keep the UI minimal
        if (game.stateManager && typeof game.stateManager.forceRunState === 'function') {
          game.stateManager.forceRunState();
        }
        game.start();
      } catch (e) {
        console.error('Failed to start Jamble', e);
      }
    }
    if (document.readyState === 'loading') {
      document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initJamble, { once: true });
    } else {
      initJamble();
    }
  })();
  </script>

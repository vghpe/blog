Yeah, it's too much work, unironically.

00:02.232 --> 00:03.795
I say that with full sincerity.

00:03.835 --> 00:07.500
It's too much work to make video game graphics better than PlayStation 2 level.

00:08.302 --> 00:14.091
And I say that unironically because too much work means higher labor costs, which means economic instability.

00:15.195 --> 00:27.000
The ability for the video game industry to produce a big budget AAA game that has a lot of money and marketing budget put behind it

00:27.195 --> 00:34.255
To experiment and be bold and take risks is is nilch because of how much work it has been to

00:35.296 --> 00:37.119
to make graphics better than the PS2 games.

00:37.359 --> 00:38.341
You could chart this out.

00:38.581 --> 00:43.000
You could make a chart, the align graph of when video games started to get bad,

00:43.581 --> 00:47.895
And it happens right around the PlayStation 3 time because development costs shoot way way up
